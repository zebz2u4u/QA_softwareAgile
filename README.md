Summary of Application:

This web application serves as a centralized platform designed to facilitate two primary types of requests from employees. Firstly, employees have the ability to request new hardware required to 
fulfil job-related tasks. They must include a comprehensive description of the task as well as optionally add a line manager who can sign off on the need for the device.
Additionally, employees can submit maintenance requests which encompass hardware and software issues, as well as general office concerns such as malfunctioning lights. Those handeling the requests (admin) can view and update
on the progress of the request. This update will then be reflected in the view of regular users/employees.

The primary objective of this application is to optimise the process of loaning hardware within the organisation, thereby expediting the tracking of device ownership and availability over time. 
Furthermore, the application endeavours to empower employees by providing them with a prompt mechanism for reporting issues, consequently enabling accelerated resolutions in contrast to conventional site checks.
